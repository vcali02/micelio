        <p>In a world with over 7 billion people, it is unsurprising the chaos that ensues. With such a massive number in mind, it is overwhelming to fathom a way to tame the masses into peace.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, humanity has an exceptional teacher in nature. In the depths of despair, mycelium emerges to feed on death to birth life. It advocates for those in need through communication within the earth and effective routing of resources.</p>
        <p>Mycelium represents life, death, and peace all through its own actions. Humanity may not be able to control the rest of humanity, but we can learn to control ourselves. We can grow in the presence of doom, we can choose peace through our actions. We have the incredible privilege to experience existence through the lense of a human. This is not to be mistaken as "easy," but regarded as an opportunity to experience a spectrum of what it is to be alive. Inherently, this spectrum requires the ability to face death, and if you allow yourself, birth life.</p>
        <p>Explore your hidden dimensions through Micelio. Discover the power within you to develop yourself into the being you envision yourself to be, and watch your life change as your growth inspires others to do the same.</p>
